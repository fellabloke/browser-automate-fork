"""Action Feedback — clean, semantic execution feedback.

The 4-tier click waterfall is ALREADY internal (the LLM issues `click`, never
`cdp_click`/`js_click`). This module finishes the abstraction by cleaning up what
the LLM is TOLD about an action:

  • SUCCESS  → terse: only the observable EFFECT (navigated / DOM changed), never
               the internal strategy name. Keeps the reasoning context clean.
  • FAILURE  → rich but SEMANTIC: a small, universal `FailureClass` + one recourse
               hint the agent can act on — never a raw tier/stack trace.

This is asymmetric verbosity: quiet when it works, specific when it doesn't.
Universal — failure classes are execution semantics (timeout/blocked/no-effect),
not site rules. The raw error is preserved in-line so downstream detectors
(Reality Monitor / Intent Journal: "timed out", "crashed") keep working unchanged.
