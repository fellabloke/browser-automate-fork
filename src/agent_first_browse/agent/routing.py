"""MoE Router — Mixture-of-Experts routing for the True Brain v16.0.

Decides which specialist worker node should handle the current step.
Uses a confidence-gated hybrid approach:

  1. FAST PATH (deterministic, zero-cost): For unambiguous situations
     where the action type is obvious from the proposed action or plan step.
     Example: proposed_action.verb == "goto" → navigator

  2. CREATIVE PATH (LLM-classified): When the situation is ambiguous,
     the router delegates to the LLM to classify the best worker.
     This preserves the agent's full creative freedom.

The key insight: routing is NOT about limiting what the agent can do.
It's about giving the agent the RIGHT specialist prompt for the situation.
A navigator sees navigation-optimized instructions. An interactor sees
click/type-optimized instructions. The LLM's creative reasoning is
PRESERVED — only the framing changes.

Why NOT pure keyword matching:
  - "Click the search button" could be navigation OR interaction
  - "Find the cheapest processor" needs extraction + navigation + interaction
  - Rigid keywords would force the wrong specialist, limiting creativity

Why NOT pure LLM classification:
  - Adds 500ms+ latency per step
  - Burns an LLM call from the rate-limited chain
  - 90% of routing decisions are obvious
