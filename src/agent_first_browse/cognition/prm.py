"""PRM Critic — Checklist-Based Process Reward Model for Step-Level Progress Scoring.

Implements the Web-Shepherd pattern (Kim et al., arXiv:2505.15277):
  1. At task start: decompose the objective into a checklist of verifiable sub-goals
  2. After each action: score which checklist items are now satisfied
  3. Reward = weighted sum of checklist scores

This provides dense, goal-aware progress signal that the heuristic ProgressCritic
cannot offer. ProgressCritic detects "did something change?" — this module detects
"did we get CLOSER TO THE GOAL?"

Integration:
  - Augments (not replaces) ProgressCritic for ambiguous verdicts
  - Serves as the value function inside WebDreamer's scoring step
  - Generates the checklist alongside _decompose_objective at task start

- The FINAL item should always describe the concrete end-state (e.g., "Confirm
  the item appears in the shopping cart" or "Verify the repository shows as starred").

- Each item should correspond to a meaningful milestone in the task"""

Think situationally about THIS task — the evidence of completion differs per goal, so reason about what a *completed* version of each sub-goal would look like on the page, then check for it. Do not apply a fixed template.

Rules:
- An item already marked "✓ VERIFIED COMPLETE" is LOCKED — keep it 'done'. A finished sub-goal does not become un-finished just because this page view doesn't re-show its proof. Never demote it.
- 'done' = there is evidence the sub-goal is complete. Evidence includes a STATE CHANGE, not only literal text — e.g. a control now showing its post-action state (active/selected/applied/added/submitted), a confirmation, a count change, or a redirect to where the result lives. A control that has switched into its "already-done" state IS proof of completion.
- 'in_progress' = partial evidence (e.g., on the right page but the action isn't reflected yet).
- 'pending' = no evidence of progress on this item.
- Set confidence 0.0-1.0; quote the concrete on-page proof in 'evidence'.
- Promote freely when you see completion; do not invent completion you can't point to."""
