"""Reality Monitor — screen-reality reconciliation.

THE BLIND-EXECUTION CURE
════════════════════════
Before every action the worker emits `expected_change` — a forward model of the
exact observable effect ("the button flips to 'Starred' and the count
increments"). Until now that prediction was generated, logged, and then THROWN
AWAY: the only post-action check (ProgressCritic) answers "did *anything* change?"
(binary progress), never "did the change we PREDICTED happen — or did the page do
something *else*?"

That gap is the root of "blind execution": a click that pops an error toast, hits
an out-of-stock state, or redirects to a login wall still makes the DOM change, so
the agent reads "progress", commits, and marches on — acting mechanically against
a screen that is actually telling it "no".

The Reality Monitor classifies the post-action page into three states:

  • CONFIRMED    — the predicted change is visibly present  → strong, trustworthy
                   progress (the success path proceeds).
  • CONTRADICTED — a *different*, adverse change happened (error / invalid /
                   rejected / unexpected redirect / captcha / out-of-stock)
                   → DO NOT commit as progress. Halt, note the discrepancy, and
                   feed it back to the worker so it re-evaluates the REAL screen.
  • NULL/UNCLEAR — nothing changed, or changed-but-ambiguous → existing behavior
                   (ineffective-streak path / optional cheap LLM reconcile).

DESIGN
  • Pure, deterministic, side-effect-free → unit-testable offline (no network).
  • Compares against the worker's OWN pre-committed prediction, never a free
    re-judgement — this sidesteps MLLM "agreement bias" (Self-Grounded
    Verification, arXiv 2507.11662), where a verifier rationalizes whatever it is
    shown.
  • CONTRADICTION only ESCALATES (a cheap re-evaluation), never terminates — so a
    rare false-positive costs one extra think, not a failed task. Conservative by
    construction.
