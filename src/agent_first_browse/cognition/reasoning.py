"""Cognition Core — strategy, belief, escalation, and stall detection (current).

This is the agent's "how it thinks" layer. It turns the brain from a stateless
step-reactor into a goal-directed reasoner that:

  1. forms an explicit STRATEGY (approach + success criteria) up front,
  2. reasons WITH that strategy every step (injected into worker prompts),
  3. updates CONFIDENCE in the strategy from evidence (reinforce / decay),
  4. escalates through a deterministic LADDER of DISTINCT tactics when stuck
     (provably never repeating a tactic for the same obstacle), and
  5. detects goal-progress STALL ("busy but not progressing") via the revived
     PRM goal-score, and re-strategizes.

Design constraints honored (from user feedback):
  - LEAN memory: beliefs are capped, de-duplicated, and truncated so the prompt
    never floods the LLM (overload → hallucination).
  - CLEAN handoff: this module is pure data/logic — all task state lives in
    BrainState (per-task), and `clear_transient()` / `clear_all()` give callers
    explicit reset points so a finished task never bleeds into the next.

Pure logic — no browser, no LLM-client construction. The single LLM call
(`restrategize`) is delegated through the injected `invoke_fn`, matching the
rest of the codebase.

  - Web-Shepherd PRM (arXiv 2505.15277): goal-aware step reward (revived here).
  - Tree-of-Thought / strategy-as-prior: conditioning the policy on a stable
