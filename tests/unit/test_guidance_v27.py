"""Unit tests for V27/P1 — the Guidance Bus (single arbitrated directive).

Guarantees:
  - build_guidance returns EXACTLY one block (or empty), honoring priority
    win > repetition > escalation > recovery.
  - The abstract PRM-checklist re-injection (critical_action_hint) is GONE.
  - render_strategy_block no longer embeds the transient goal_complete_hint.

Run: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_guidance_v27.py -v
